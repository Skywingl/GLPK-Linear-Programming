# GLPK-Linear-Programming
My homework for COMP331/557 Optimisation. <br />(Donâ€™t worry about academic issues, the assignments are different every year)

# File description
## p1.py
The main program, used to output n lp files that can be run by simple GLPK and call them on the command line. 
By my own standards, this code is not elegant, but it is sufficient for a deadline with a time limit.
## p2.py
The supplementary program, just output all 531,441 possibilities into a csv file.
## cases.csv
Record all 531,441 possibilities, as the output of p2.py.
## lp directory
Since I want the files to be organized in a unified manner, I asked the program to put all the lp files generated by p1.py into the lp folder.
## output directory
For the same reason, I asked the program to put all the lp files generated by p1.py into the lp folder.

# Comment
I only uploaded part of the lp and output documents, because the amount of data is too large. It is worth mentioning that the document numbered 332052 is the final optimal result. By the way, this is the first time I uploaded my code and related files on GitHub. Maybe there are some irregularities. I'm sorry for that.:disappointed_relieved:
