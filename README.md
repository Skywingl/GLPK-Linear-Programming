# GLPK-Linear-Programming
My homework for COMP331/557 Optimisation. <br />
(Donâ€™t worry about academic issues, the assignments are different every year)

# File description
Basically, if anyone wants to run my codes, you need to put these files/directories in the same directory (or you can change my codes).
## p1.py
The main program, used to output n lp files that can be run by simple GLPK and call them on the command line. 
By my own standards, this code is not elegant, but it is sufficient for a deadline with a time limit.
## p2.py
The supplementary program, just output all 531,441 possibilities into a csv file.
## cases.csv
Record all 531,441 possibilities, as the output of p2.py. <br />
But it's too large to upload. You need to get this file through p2.py first.
## lp directory
Since I want the files to be organized in a unified manner, I asked the program to put all the lp files generated by p1.py into the lp folder.
## output directory
For the same reason, I asked the program to put all the lp files generated by p1.py into the lp folder.

# Comment
I only upload the lp and output documents numbered 332052 in related directories, because the 332052th combination is the optimal result. Also, it can be viewed as an example.<br />
By the way, this is the first time I uploaded my code and related files on GitHub. Maybe there are some irregularities. I'm sorry for that.:disappointed_relieved:
